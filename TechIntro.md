## Frontend Mobile: Getting Started with Flutter
A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:
- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)
For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## First Steps to create your Backend with Oracle Apex
Orcale Apex is a framework to design and hosting a database, create web-based-Apps on that database configering UI-Forms and enable easy to use RESTful interfaces to your database.

- [UWC and HNU video casts] (will you find in our moodle)
## Backend with InfluxDB and Grafana
## Introduction into IoT using RaspPi and Arduino
Here you will find some tutorials to programming Microcontroller to read sensors, control actors and connect to an infrastructure like RESTful webService:
- [RaspPi: Getting Started with RaspPi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html)
- [Arduino: Getting Started with Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc)

We will support:
- RaspPi 4.0
- Arduino MKR WiFi 1010
- Arduino NodeMCU ESP8266 ESP-12FWiFi
