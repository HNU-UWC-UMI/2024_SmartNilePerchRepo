## Stakeholder

| Role         | Contact        | Expectations      |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Product Owner| dany.meyer@hnu.de | I expect a system as a prototype with which I can demonstrate a digital solution that monitors and evaluates the temperature and position of a box. I would like to experience the creation of the prototype within a week by an agile team.|

| 3 | General planning/identifting/defining tools to use/understanding the integration of the the use case | looking at the raspeberry and the different sensors to use that will be applicable for counting and measuring the fish/created a simulation environment to use the scale to define weight of the fish. The simualation code worked but we change the plan to use a infared sensor | Integrating count system with temperature system | Database implemention and connection| Building the system and presentation |
| 4 |  General Planning procedures / increment for group and the whole project | Prepraring a Prototyp for the UI using MIRO / Deciding on a DBMS + First Considerations about InfluxDB / Firebase and finally Oracle Apex + Establishing first ER & ERR_Models| Getting started on Oracle Apex / Table Creation / REST-API | Integrating the other Groups in the DB / Refining Processes / Integrating the general Form for the Insepctor / Creation of UI-Interface using Oracle Apex| Final Refinements before the Presentation (Integration of the optimized Inspector_Report + Preparation Process for the Final_Presentation |
